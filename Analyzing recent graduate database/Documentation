•	Show Majors with ShareWomen > 0.5
•	Select majors with women in the minority.
•	Show majors with female majority and median salary > 500
•	Show median >= 10000 OR unemployed people <= 1000
•	Show Engineering where sharewomen >= 0.5 , unemployment_rate < 0.051
•	Show Majors order by ShareWomen in Descending order
•	Show Major category in Engineering or Physical Science ordered by Unemployment rate by Ascending order
•	Count number of majors
•	Show Engineering Major with lowest median salary.
•	Show the aggregating such as average of total, minimum of men and maximum of women
•	Show the number of roles and the highest unemployment rate.
•	Show unique values of majors, major category and major code using DISTINCT()
