o	Write a query that returns each genre, with the number of tracks sold in absolute numbers and in percentages.
o	Create a plot to show this data.
o	Write a paragraph that interprets the data and makes a recommendation for the three artists whose albums we should purchase for the store, based on sales of tracks from their genres.
•	Analyzing Employee Sales Performance
